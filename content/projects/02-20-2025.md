## ðŸ›  Overview

The **Server Cloning Automation** project was developed to streamline the rebuilding and cleaning of hosts in a financial transaction environment. Previously, the team had to manually clean up test environments, which was a time-consuming process that took **weeks** to complete. This project leverages **GitLab**, **Pipelines**, and **Runners** to automate critical tasks such as:

- **Registry Host Level Cleanup**: Automatically cleaning up registry entries from previous configurations to ensure a clean environment for the next deployment.
- **Microsoft SQL Server Cleanup**: Automated cleanup of SQL Server instances, removing old configurations and ensuring the database environment is ready for new deployments.

## âš¡ Key Features

- **GitLab Integration**: GitLab CI/CD pipelines and runners manage the automation tasks, providing seamless integration and version control.
- **Registry Host Cleanup**: Uses custom scripts in the pipeline to identify and remove outdated registry entries, ensuring hosts are clean for new configurations.
- **SQL Server Cleanup**: Automates the cleanup of Microsoft SQL Server, removing obsolete data and resetting configurations to improve performance and security.
- **Automation of Rebuilds**: Fully automated host rebuild process using pipelines for environment consistency and scalability.
- **Test Environment Optimization**: Reduces the time spent cleaning test environments from weeks to **hours**, improving overall efficiency and throughput.

## ðŸš€ Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Significantly reduced manual intervention by automating the host rebuild and cleanup processes.
- **Consistency**: Ensured consistent host environments by automating cleanup tasks, eliminating human error.
- **Scalability**: Streamlined the process for scaling the deployment of hosts, allowing the environment to grow efficiently without compromising quality.
- **Time Savings**: What previously took weeks to clean up in the test environment is now accomplished in **hours**, accelerating development and testing cycles.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals Achieved

- Successfully automated the **host rebuild process** for Postilion environments.
- Integrated **GitLab Pipelines** and **Runners** to handle complex tasks like **registry cleanup** and **SQL Server reset**.
- Reduced test environment cleanup time from weeks to **hours**, enabling faster iterations and deployments.
- Improved overall testing efficiency and reduced downtime for development teams.
